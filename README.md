# Galaxy Asteroids

## About

<p align="justify">
Galaxy Asteroids consists of a singleplayer/multiplayer and multi-screen game that looks like the old Asteroids with the Diep.io mechanics. Players will control their spaceships in a limited battlefield (the space), visible into the Liquid Galaxy system (screens), with their virtual joystick (mobile app), fighting each other in a thirsty competition in order to achieve the highest score, being what most players like.
